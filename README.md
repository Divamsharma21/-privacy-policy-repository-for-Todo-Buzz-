# Privacy Policy for Todo Buzz Chrome Extension

Effective Date: 06-04-2025

1. Overview
Todo Buzz is a Chrome extension designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks directly within the browser. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected, how it is used, and the measures taken to protect user data.

2. Information Collection and Use
Local Storage:
Todo Buzz utilizes the browser's built-in localStorage to store your to-do list data directly on your device. This means:

Data Storage: All task data is saved locally on your computer and is not transmitted to any external servers.

Data Retention: The data remains in your localStorage until you choose to delete it or uninstall the extension.

No Remote Code Execution:
Todo Buzz does not execute any remote code. All functionalities are encapsulated within the extension package, ensuring that no external scripts or codes are fetched or executed from remote servers.

3. Data Security
No Data Transmission:
Since all data is stored locally and the extension does not communicate with external servers, the risk of data interception during transmission is eliminated.

User Control:
You have full control over your data. Tasks can be added, edited, or deleted at your discretion. Uninstalling the extension will remove all associated data from your browser.

4. Third-Party Services
Todo Buzz does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services or APIs. All operations are performed within the extension without external dependencies.

5. Children's Privacy
Todo Buzz does not knowingly collect any information from individuals under the age of 13. As no personal data is collected or transmitted, it complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected with a new effective date at the top of this document. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically for any updates.
